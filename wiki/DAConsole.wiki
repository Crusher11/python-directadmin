#summary Basic intercative console for managing a Directadmin Server
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

One of the sample scripts included in the source of python-directadmin, is called daconsole.py. This little script provides an interactive console to interact with a Directadmin Server. 

Currently the commands available within this console are very few. In the future some more could be added, and the console itself could be refined. 

= Details =

The current commands available in the console are:

  * `connect`     - Connect to a Directadmin Server
  * `help`        - Print command information
  * `quit`        - Quit the console
  * `server_info` - Prints statistical information about the server
  * `suspend`     - Suspends a user on Directadmin
  * `unsuspend`   - Un-suspends a user on Directadmin
  * `version`     - Print version information

= To-Do =

  * Implement more API commands
  * The `connect` command currently works only on interactive mode, you call it and it asks you for the connection information. The user should be able to pass that information as a parameter of the command.
  * Connection information could also be defined at a configuration file
  * The console should be able to handle more than one host, so that a single console running on one box could monitor many different servers
